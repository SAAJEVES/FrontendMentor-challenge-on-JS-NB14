## Overview 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned
Nothing new was learnt on css but testing my css skills on styling of form was tested and I had to go for a refresher course. On js, this is my first time of me writing a validation function(s) for a form element.


### Continued development
My JS skill is still at it lowest ebb, so, more work needs to be done on upgrading it.


### Useful resources

A lot of resources was helpful not just in this project but from the beginning of my learning of web development.

- And lots more. Surely, I will always recommend them days in and days out
